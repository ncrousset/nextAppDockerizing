# Dockerizing nextjs project

dockerize a Next.js project with TypeScript, if you want to use JavaScript, delete all files except docker-compose, Dockerfile, and dockerignore. Then, start a new Next.js project and create the app folder. If you are going to use pages, you need to modify the Dockerfile.

## Steps
``` [bash] 
docker-compose build
```

``` [bash] 
docker-compose up
```
